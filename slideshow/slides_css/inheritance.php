	<h4>Inheritance</h4>
	<p>Each element in an HTML document is part of a tree, and every element except the initial <html> element has a parent element that encloses it. Whatever styles are applied to that parent element can be applied to the elements enclosed in it if the properties are inherited</p>
	<ul class="build no-bullet">
		<li>
			<pre class="prettyprint"><h6>This is a <em>Big</em> Headline</h6></pre>
		</li>
		<li>The EM element is a child of the H1 element, and any styles on the H1 that are inherited will be passed on to the EM text as well. For example: h6 { color: red; }</li>
	</ul>
