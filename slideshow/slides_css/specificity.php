	<h4>Specificity</h4>
	<p>Specificity is calculated using a formula that is based on the selector section of your CSS rule. Specificity determines, which CSS rule is applied by the browsers.</p>
	<ul class="build no-bullet">
		<li>Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector:</li>
		<li>
			<ul class="no-bullet">
				<li>1. Inline Styles</li>
				<li>2. IDs</li>
				<li>3. Classes and pseudo-classes</li>
				<li>4. Elements and pseudo-elements</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
